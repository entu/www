    ## Easy application
    Every individual, institution, company, organization creates data that needs to be organized, stored, shared with users for viewing or editing. Most information systems are designed to fit only a narrow business area. Modifying them is expensive. New, stand-alone databases are being created for changing needs. In most cases, it is also difficult to interconnect them and movement of data between systems is done manually.

    Entu  adapts easily to the composition of your data. The types of data objects, their parameters and relationships can described quickly All of this can be changed and added anytime. Thanks to Entu's flexibility, all your information is gathered here, eliminating the need for interfacing between different systems or  exchanging information manually.

    ## Data objects
    Entu stores data in objects. Object types can be defined (for example book, person, article, folder, activity) and always added or changed later. When defining an object type you can give it a name and description; determine in which module (or menu item) objects of this type are displayed; what other types of objects it is related to, etc. One object can contain other objects (for example, a folder of documents, textbook chapters, etc.).

    Each object has parameters (for example, a book has a title, author, year of publication). Parameters can be text, number, date, reference (to another object), and more. You can set a name and description for each parameter; whether it is visible to the public; whether it can be searched and / or sorted; what is the default value; whether this parameter can be entered once  or more (for example, a book has one title but several authors) and so on. In addition to static data fields, there are dynamic fields calculated from other data fields or other object fields.

    ## Rights
    User authentication is done through Google, Apple, LHV Bank, (Estonian) Mobile ID and (Estonian) ID Card and user permissions are object based - there is no definition of role in the system. Each object has an owner(s). The owner can determine who has access to this object, who can modify, add, delete.

    ## Security
    All traffic between your browser and the Entu server is encrypted. Your password is not saved in Entu - it will not even flow through us. A daily copy of your database is stored on servers in three different parts of the world.

    ## Preset modules
    Several modules have been pre-configured to facilitate deployment. The object types in these modules try to cover different information needs and show you the power of Entu. You can modify and expand these preset modules and objects, or delete them. Some of the preset modules are for example, staff and contacts; document management; library; premises and stock.
